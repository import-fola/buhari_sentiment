# Buhari Sentiment Analysis - Is Naij Twitter a bubble?   
This is a question I set out to myself to answer during the recent Nigerian elections. There seemed to be quite a negtaive sentiment of reigning President Buhari. I wondered whether this sentiment applied to the larger Nigerian demographic.  
So I scraped tweets about Buhari from twitter and compared the sentiment to a national job satisfaction poll on President Buhari to test this thesis.
